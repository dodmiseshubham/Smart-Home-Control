# Personalized Smart home control

## Introduction
Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled innovations in smart homes and in- dustrial automation, allowing home devices to be monitored and controlled remotely. Such solu- tions have resulted in energy efficiency and cost savings, as appliances are monitored and con- trolled by small, resource-constrained embedded devices. Climate control is one application area that has a significant role in our day-to-day life. Introducing smarter and more intelligent ways to control these devices can be a good area to focus on. This can be implemented using the use of the optimal infrastructure of software and hardware.


## Motivation
Having the perfect climate for your room/home is all about controlling and setting the temperature. Deciding what can be the perfect climate depends on mainly two factors the choice of the user and how is the weather outside. Every person has dif- ferent preferences for the climate of the room so every time he has to go to switch and make the changes. Introducing some autonomous systems in place can make the experience for users pleas- ant without interrupting daily chores and worry. And even outside weather will also do the same effect and to make such decisions and control need a software model which will be capable of making its own decision on the data gathered in past and present weather plays.


## Proposed Approach
An air conditioning system with a tempera- ture sensor collects data. That data will be sent to a cloud server via MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport). Initially, the system will not be having any information about the user’s prefer- ences. Over the course of time for weeks and a few months, data will be collected in a database. Once enough data is collected machine learning model will be trained. For the model, simple regression or a decision tree can be used to train the model on past data. So based on the output generated by the model decision will be made by the system to control the speed of the AC fan. Also, based on real-time data by public weather API’s suggestion temperature will be tuned to create a pleasant cli- mate in a room.

## Workflow
The temperature sensor will be connected to ESP32 or raspberry pi ( will decide during the implementation phase as per more applications). ESP32 will be connected to the public/local cloud wirelessly using MQTT. Either I will be using a public cloud like AWS, AZURE, etc., or will be creating API in a local python server. Collected data will be stored in a database with the current temperature, time, and day. A machine learning model will be trained on this data. I will be us- ing Mateo API to get data on real-time temper- ature and other weather related data for that loca- tion. Considering all this parameters final decision about fan speed will be made. I will use MOSFET which will be used on the actuator part to control the speed of the fan physically

## Hardware
• Temperature sensor: LM35 or DST11/22
• ESP32: Microcontrollers with integrated Wi- Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth
• Fan: 12V DC Fan
• N-channel MOSFET

## Software
• MQTT protocol: is a lightweight, publish- subscribe, a machine-to-machine network protocol for message queue/message queuing service.
• Public cloud: Wireless endpoints open for connection with ESP32 or a raspberry pi.
• Database: Relational ( MySQL)/non rela- tional(MongoDB) database service to store data.
• Weather API: Mateo API
• Machine learning: Regression and decision
tree.
