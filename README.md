# Smart-Home-Control
1 Introduction
Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled innovations in smart homes and in- dustrial automation, allowing home devices to be monitored and controlled remotely. Such solu- tions have resulted in energy efficiency and cost savings, as appliances are monitored and con- trolled by small, resource-constrained embedded devices. Climate control is one application area that has a significant role in our day-to-day life. Introducing smarter and more intelligent ways to control these devices can be a good area to focus on. This can be implemented using the use of the optimal infrastructure of software and hardware.
